    <h3>Success Credits the Sixties</h3>
    <p>If you had never listened to the English rock band Oasis, formed in 1991, you would probably think they sound a lot like the Beatles. In fact, you wouldn't be too far off, because the group credits much of their inspiration to their predecessors Paul McCartney and John Lennon. Although lead lyricist Noel Gallagher argues up to the present day how comparisons to the Beatles are not entirely accurate, it is hard to deny that they do not follow similar narratives in their style and discography. Popular 30 years after their influences, the band Oasis in the 1990s was discovered by the head of indie-label Creation Records, Alan McGee. Together, Oasis saved the floundering label and became a commercial and creative success, resonating with a new alternative movement.</p>

    <h3>Writing a Second Album</h3>
    <p>“Don't Look Back in Anger” is an iconic rock ballad from Oasis' sophomore album What's the Story (Morning Glory). While the band was facing certain pressure to follow their first album's success, the art of their songwriting comes in simple strives. The goal they had in mind when writing this new album was to focus on strong choruses. If your song has a great chorus with a great tune to sing along to, then people will enjoy it—it was a simple premise. Album producer Owen Morris claims that for one week, they recorded a different song from the album each day. </p>
    <p>While in the midst of writing “Don't Look Back in Anger,” Noel Gallagher was preparing to play Oasis' first big arena gig two nights later. He already had the chords for the song figured out and was playing around with the lyrics. He continued to do this at their gig's soundcheck, where someone interrupted him with misheard lyrics. Gallagher enjoyed the lines “and so Sally can wait” and started to run off with the rest of the chorus. He wrote and finished the song in his dressing room that night and went on to play it for the first time ever at the same concert in front of nearly 20,000 people.</p>
