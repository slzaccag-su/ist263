    <body>
    I’m Sierra Zaccagnino, an advertising major at Syracuse University, as well as a student in the i-school and the fashion & beauty communications milestone. Creative communications have always interested me because I’m passionate about the intersection between writing, art, and business. Since my freshmen year, I’ve worked as a strategist with a local ad agency on campus, TNH Agency—the largest student-run ad agency in the nation—and I serve as a Newhouse Ambassador in which I lead information sessions and give tours to prospective students. Also, I have a foundation in the Adobe Suite with knowledge of Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Apart from my education and campus involvement, I enjoy making music on my Steinway & Sons Grand Piano and reading books in any Barnes and Nobles Starbucks.
