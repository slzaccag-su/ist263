    <p id="firstline">The art of songwriting is more than the business of songwriting. </p>
    <p>Behind every great song is an artist with their own creative process and journey.</p>
    <p>If you've ever wondered how your favorite song came to be, wonder no more! Start discovering here with our selection of artist and song profiles. While this site highlights prominent 20th-century artists, it also delves into interviews with current singers and songwriters. Whether you're just a casual listener, an avid music lover, or a working artist, we all consume music and take part in the listener-writer dynamic.</p>
    <p>We find ourselves addicted to the search, as music that moves us can capture a moment, convey a message, or put things into perspective. While our content focuses on the writer's end of our relationship with music, don't forget to consider how the listener influences the creative process of artists, and vice versa.</p>
