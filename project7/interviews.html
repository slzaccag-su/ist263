    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>Sam Keeler is the lyricist and front-man of the five-piece band Path. Publications have described Path as “indie rock” and online the band self-identifies as “New Age Love Rock”-- a unique moniker given to them from a fellow folk singer. Drawing on inspiration from nature and folk music, Path is the musical project currently based in Philadelphia of friends who find passion in creating and performing together. The availability of their recording spaces and busy lives have never prevented them from making quality music with which they hope people can connect. From recording songs at the university Keeler attended to now playing shows across several states, the band has come a long way. With two albums out in the world and another one awaiting its release, Path continues to discover the depths of their dreamy, acoustic, and boundless sound.</strong></i></p>
    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>I had the pleasure of speaking with Keeler over a video chat where we discussed the beginnings of Path, the details of his writing and recording process, and the struggles of creating in the modern music world as well as wi thin today's online culture. Keeler reflected on how has grown as a musical artist over the past few years and shared his excitement of Path's next big project-- their third album.</strong></i></p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>How long have you been involved in music?</strong></i><br>
    I started recording music in this capacity in 2017 or late 2016 when I was in college– I went to American University for recorded music. I started recording my own music as school projects, trying to get school credit for making stuff. An7d so the first album, my friend Dawson and I put it together, and my current roommate and guitarist for the band–Don–would come down. We were just working on it in college and then I figured out how to record music, make songs that are radio ready and commercially viable.</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>Who do you consider your creative inspirations?</strong></i><br>
    Well, folk singers like Nick Drake are probably the biggest ones. Joni Mitchell’s probably another one of the biggest ones. But I get most of my inspiration from lyricism and songwriting from folk music, usually the 60s and 70s. What’s another one? John Martin. </p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>When you start to write a song, what does your process look like? What does it sound like?</strong></i><br>
    90% of the time, I'm just playing the acoustic guitar in the evening time and get an iPhone voice memo going with an idea–a structure. The words usually come last. So I'll just be sitting on the couch and recording a voice memo while singing or humming the melody idea. It usually starts with the chord structure on a guitar and I'll get the vocal melody in there, but no words. Unless they come really fast, which happens– I've done entire songs in one little sitting. But usually the idea is there and then the words will be evoked out of the feeling of the song. I try to make the words match the vibe. If it’s a sad song, sad words, if it's a happy sounding song, happy words, you know?</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>Yes, your sound always feels very organic and atmospheric. You evoke a lot of imagery of places and seasons, is that something that naturally happens in your process or is that intentional in your writing?</strong></i><br>
    Yeah, thanks. I just like being outside– I’m an avid fisherman. I grew up by the Delaware River and spent a lot of time in the Adirondacks and on the lakes, so that probably comes from how much I like to be by water. And whenever I’ve gone through internal strife in the past, I stick it in the music. Honestly, I’ve gotten to the point where I can evoke stuff without having to go through a crisis. . . I used to be sad and then write sad songs about being sad. Now, I can just tap into that after doing it so many times and recording. 90% of it’s the science side– if you can capture the good essence of a thing, then most of the work is just sitting at the computer for 100 hours trying to make it sound good. The whole vibey part comes from being outside and trying to channel the feeling of being around nature into the music.</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>You mentioned sitting in front of a computer, does that take up a large part of your process? </strong></i><br>
    It’s probably 95% of the time. Sometimes, there’ll be times where I capture something that I think, oh wow, that was totally magical– that iPhone voice memo is the essence of what I want to get. But obviously these voice memos aren't good sound quality or anything. So the challenge becomes how do we capture that in high fidelity? <br>
    All the music is recorded at home, so we have a little recording studio in the basement here in Philadelphia. Trying to take that acoustic performance and then beef it up to a full band composition and keep the essence of that, that’s the challenge. It just takes a long, long time because everything needs to be meticulously produced. We don’t work with any mixers or engineers. It’s all done by ourselves, so it’s a tremendous amount of work.</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>Going back to 2017, that was the year your debut album <u>Path</u> was released. What was the vision behind that project?</strong></i><br>
    That album was my final project for college and we had access to a really nice studio through our audio department. I wanted to figure out a way to make my own music with the studio, so I kinda finagled the department into letting me make original songs. They were gonna give me college credit for every finished song that was over two minutes long, and I ended up doing 12. My friend Dawson and I, he’s a sound engineer, we shared enthusiasm for the prospect of making music after I showed him some demos. We just went in there one day, booked time, and the first song came out of it. I think it was “Room on the Hill,” the one with the crazy drums in it. We just got stoked on it and kept making music. For that whole college semester all the songs were done in the studio, except for that song “April Winds” I did in my little basement room. I was just trying to hone in on the sound and I think I definitely got it a little clearer.
    </p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>How did your collaboration process work during that time?</strong></i><br>
    I didn’t really know how to make music. Dawson’s a lot more scientifically adept at that stuff. He was paying a lot more attention in the classes we were taking for recording music. So I would go in and have an idea, then he would kind of explain how he was doing this. We had a big soundboard with a million buttons, so he taught me through making the music with me how to do all this stuff. </p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>From that first album, “Eugene” became pretty popular. How did you feel when that happened?</strong></i><br>
    A girl who’s a fashion blogger put that in one of her videos, her name’s Ashley. I guess she was really popular because that video was number one on Youtube’s trending page that whole day. I tried to reach out to thank her for doing that because it took us out of obscurity a bit. Now Spotify, they’re the playlist curators that are really tuned into that kind of thing. So the week that video came out they started putting “Eugene” on their daily mixes and playlist rotations– and it’s still cranking when I go onto my Spotify artist page. There’s just people constantly listening because it’s worldwide on Spotify’s playlists, which is mind-numbing to think about and it’s all thanks to Ashley. Funny, funny the way it works like that.</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>Are there any other tracks from your debut that stand out to you?</strong></i><br>
    I’ve always thought “There’s Room on the Hill” was the one I was most proud of. But I think that’s just because it’s the weirdest one. It’s definitely not the most accessible, but that was the one where I thought I really made something cool this time. I don't know where all that stuff came from. I remember I was living in Washington, DC and I had a little apartment with a balcony where you could kind of see Rock Creek Park. It was really pretty to sit out at night– I wrote all the songs out there. </p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>How did you create the arrangement on one of your newest singles, “Time Takes Away”?</strong>
    </i><br>
    The whole mission of the recording process is to reproduce the magic of the first time the song comes into reality in your head. Because after a while, you get desensitized to the evocative nature of the songs as you listen to them 10,000 times trying to tweak every meticulous little detail.<br>
    You start making the song and then keep adding stuff you think it needs. And luckily, the way that song is, I don't think it needed much– just a couple of guitar tracks, the bass, and the shaker. Yeah, and there’s a plugin. There’s one that Soundtoys makes called crystallizer. I put it on the electric guitar on just about every song. It’s this crazy sound– it’s a delay and it’s really pretty. If I played a guitar for you going through crystallizer, you would instantly be like, oh, that’s a big part of their sound. So that song was a love letter to crystallizer, which was really ethereal.</p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>What do you think it means to be a songwriter today?</strong></i><br>
    From a logistical standpoint, it’s pretty challenging. When I started making music TikTok didn’t exist, now TikTok is the biggest thing ever. And because we’re not signed to a label and we do all the press and promotion ourselves, it’s a headache. It’s also easier than ever because I basically have the recording power of Abbey Roads Studios of the 60s in my house, which is amazing. This music wouldn’t exist if I would have to go through the 1990s route where I’d have to pitch my songs on tape to a label who would give me money to record it, so I’m grateful that I’m a songwriter now. 
    </p>

    <p class="lefttext"><i><strong>What does the future of music have in store for you, and what do you have in store for the future of music?</strong></i><br>
    ight now on our radar we’re just trying to be as good of a live band as we can, put out some new music, and keep people excited. As for what the music industry has in store for us? I have no idea, we’ll find out.</p>
