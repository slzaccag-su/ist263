    <h1>Sierra Zaccagnino's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p id="content">I'm Sierra Zaccagnino, an advertising major at Syracuse University, as well as a student in the i-school and the fashion & beauty communications milestone. <strong>Creative communications</strong> have always interested me because I'm passionate about the intersection between writing, art, and business. Since my freshmen year, I've worked as a strategist with a local ad agency on campus, TNH Agency—the largest student-run ad agency in the nation—and I serve as a Newhouse Ambassador in which I lead information sessions and give tours to prospective students.</p>
    <p>When I'm not busy with my campus involvements, you can find me making music on my Steinway & Sons Grand Piano or reading books in any Barnes and Nobles Starbucks. </p>
